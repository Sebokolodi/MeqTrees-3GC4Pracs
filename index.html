							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
				<p> <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font>, as
					you might have heard from the previous lectures, is simply a software 
					tool that allows us to:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Generate visibilities through simulations and
 <li> calibrate both the simulated and real astronomical data.
</ul>
<p>
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> uses the Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation (RIME)  or in short, the Measurement Equation to try and predict visibilities by modelling what we think the observed sky looks like and then corrupting the model with various propagation effects. Such effects include 
the bandpass, receiver complex gains, polarisation leakage, primary beam, parallactic angle (for alt-az mount such as the JVLA, KAT7, MeerKAT) and atmospheric phases. The Measurement Equation is very flexible in a such a way that it allows the different effects to be representated as separate terms, thus, making it possible to solve for the individual effects independently. </p>
Corruption effects are generally grouped into direction independent (DI) and direction dependent (DD).
						The DI effects occur at the antennas and are
						referred to as <em>uv-</em>plane effects,
						and the DD effects occur close to an astronomical 
						object and hence, referred to as the image-plane effects.
<p>
Calibration methods developed to correct for DI effects are referred to as 2GC methods, and those that
	incorporate the correction of DD effects are 3GC methods. For this practical, we going
	to focus only on 2GC methods and the next practical will be on 3GC methods.
	The 2GC methods assume that all the effects are DI, and any effect which is DD such as the 
	primary beam is constant in time and identical across all receivers.						
I recommend the following papers for further reading on RIME and its 
	implementation on modern calibration algorithms; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1764">RIME1</a>,
	<a ref="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1765">RIME1</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1768">RIME1</a>, 
	and also refer to therein.

						<h2> Logging to elwood and Check list </h2>

I suppose by now all of us should have access to elwood. Login to elwood, and go to a directory named "Meqtrees2GC. Inside this directory you should find:
<ol>
    <li> The sky model <font color="red"> summs_field_kat7.lsm.html </font>. This model is in <font face="MathJax_SansSerif" size="2em"> Tigger </font> format and it contains sources drawn
    from SUMSS covering approximately the field of view of the KAT-7 instrument. The survey 
	    from which they are drawn was conducted at 843 MHz so the sources have had their
	    fluxes extrapolated to what they would be at 1445 MHz assuming a spectral index of 0.7,
	    recall   $\large{S\sim \nu^{\alpha}}$.  
    
    <li> The <font color="red"> KAT_ANTENNAS </font> -- this file contains the 
	    information about the instrument such as antenna positions, 
       dish size, elevation, etc.
     
    <li> The configuration file <font color="red"> config.json </font>.
 </ol>

<h3> Additional Packages: Tigger and SIMMS 
</h3>

Earlier I did mention <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> and 
	I think you deserve to know what it is. Ok, so <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> 
	is a tool designed to help us view and edit the sky models, and also to view images. 
	You might be familiar with similar tools such as <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> kvis </font>, 
	<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> ds9 </font>, etc. You can open the above sky model using 
	<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> by typing the command that follows, 
						and you may close it when you're done appreciating it.
	<p>
    $ tigger summs_field_kat7.lsm.html 
						</p>
<p>
We need a file in which we can write and store data (visibilities) and this file is
	called a Measurement Set (MS -- CASA Table). We are going to create an 
	empty MS file using a software package called <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font>.			
A typical MS should contain information such as a central frequency of the observation, 
	a total observation time (synthesis time), integration time
	per visibilty point, 
	number of channels and the pointing centre defined in terms of right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC).
</p>
We can provide all these information on the command line but this can become tideous. 
	An alternative is to provide the configuration file. Below I attached an image 
	showing what this file entails, and you can also open it
	(<font color="red"> config.json </font>) with an editor of your choice and you will see the following. 
						Note that I added comments to options I added something.  
You can find more definitions by using the help command of <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font>

  <center> <figcaption> Figure 1. Simms Configuration File </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
<blockquote>
For our observation, the central frequency=1445MHz, pointing centre ra = 19h 15m 53.304s,
	dec = -74d39m37.90s, the observation time=12hours, and integration time=60 seconds. 
	We using a single channel of width 16MHz and consider all the correlation outputs. 
						</blockquote>
Lets create our MS file by running <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> on the command line using:
    $ <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> -jc config.json
  
If successful, you should see the message: ##INFO: <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> succeeded
