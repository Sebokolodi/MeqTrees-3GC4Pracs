							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
				<p> <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font>, as
					you might have heard from the previous lectures, is simply a software 
					tool that allows us to:</p>
<ul>
 <li> Generate visibilities through simulations and
 <li> calibrate both the simulated and real astronomical data.
</ul>
<p>
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> uses the Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation (RIME)  or in short, the Measurement Equation to try and predict visibilities by modelling what we think the observed sky looks like and then corrupting the model with various propagation effects. Such effects include 
the bandpass, receiver complex gains, polarisation leakage, primary beam, parallactic angle (for alt-az mount such as the JVLA, KAT7, MeerKAT) and atmospheric phases. The Measurement Equation is very flexible in a such a way that it allows the different effects to be representated as separate terms, thus, making it possible to solve for the individual effects independently. </p>
Corruption effects are generally grouped into direction independent (DI) and direction dependent (DD).
						The DI effects occur at the antennas and are
						referred to as <em>uv-</em>plane effects,
						and the DD effects occur close to an astronomical 
						object and hence, referred to as the image-plane effects.
<p>
Calibration methods developed to correct for DI effects are referred to as 2GC methods, and those that
	incorporate the correction of DD effects are 3GC methods. For this practical, we going
	to focus only on 2GC methods and the next practical will be on 3GC methods.
	The 2GC methods assume that all the effects are DI, and any effect which is DD such as the 
	primary beam is constant in time and identical across all receivers.						
I recommend the following papers for further reading on RIME and its 
	implementation on modern calibration algorithms; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1764">RIME1</a>,
	<a ref="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1765">RIME2</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1768">RIME3</a>, 
	and also refer to references therein.

						<h2> Logging to elwood and Check list </h2>
</header >
I suppose by now all of us should have access to elwood. Login to elwood, 
and go to a directory named "Meqtrees2GC. Inside this directory you should find:
<ol>
    <li> The sky model <font color="red"> summs_field_kat7.lsm.html </font>. This model is in <font face="MathJax_SansSerif" size="2em"> Tigger </font> format and it contains sources drawn
    from SUMSS covering approximately the field of view of the KAT-7 instrument. The survey 
	    from which they are drawn was conducted at 843 MHz so the sources have had their
	    fluxes extrapolated to what they would be at 1445 MHz assuming a spectral index of 0.7.
    
    <li> The <font color="red"> KAT_ANTENNAS </font> -- this file contains the 
	    information about the instrument such as antenna positions, 
       dish size, elevation, etc.
     
    <li> The configuration file <font color="red"> config.json </font>.
 </ol>

<h3> Additional Packages: Tigger and SIMMS 
</h3>

Earlier I did mention <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> and 
	I think you deserve to know what it is. Ok, so <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> 
	is a tool designed to help us view and edit the sky models, and also to view images. 
	You might be familiar with similar tools such as <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> kvis </font>, 
	<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> ds9 </font>, etc. You can open the above sky model using 
	<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> Tigger </font> by typing the command that follows, 
						and you may close it when you're done appreciating it.
	<p>
    $ tigger summs_field_kat7.lsm.html 
						</p>
<p>
We need a file in which we can write and store data (visibilities) and this file is
	called a Measurement Set (MS -- CASA Table). We are going to create an 
	empty MS file using a software package called <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font>.			
A typical MS should contain information such as a central frequency of the observation, 
	a total observation time (synthesis time), integration time
	per visibilty point, 
	number of channels and the pointing centre defined in terms of right ascension (ra) and declination (dec).
</p>
We can provide all these information on the command line but this can become tideous. 
	An alternative approach is to provide the configuration file, see Fig 1 (with commends amended for the 
						parameters we considered). 
You can find more definitions by using <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> help command.

						
<figure>
  <img src="images/fulls/configcomments.jpg">
  <center> <figcaption> Figure 1. Simms Configuration File </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
<blockquote text-align:right>
For our observation, the central frequency=1445MHz, pointing centre ra = 19h 15m 53.304s,
	dec = -74d39m37.90s, the observation time=12hours, integration time=60 seconds,  
	using only a single channel of width 16MHz and all the correlation outputs. 
						</blockquote>
Lets create our MS file by running <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> on the command line using: <br/>
    $ <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> -jc config.json
  <br />
If successful, you should see the message: ##INFO: <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> simms </font> succeeded

				<h2>  Simulating Visibilities: No Noise and Instrumental Effects </h2>

You may be wondering why do we need to simulate the data to begin with?. Well, for our 
case we don't have much  choice since we don't have any real observed data, so we are basically 
trying to create own corrupted data which we will calibrate later :). 

<ul>
<li> But generally, you would want to simulate data to get a better understanding of the instrument.
<li> Or when you want to write observation proposal and you want to convince the time 
	allocation commitee that you've at least considered the feasibility of detecting something with
	their precious telescope time. 
</ul>

<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees </font> comes bundled with a simulation framework known as 
						Siamese, and we can get to this file by:

<ul>
<li> on the command line you can open <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees </font> using $meqbrowser
<li> A window will open, press start.
<li> select "TDL" then "Load TDL script"
<li> Navigate to "Cattery" folder then select "Siamese" and load "turbo-sim.py"
</ul>

Once turbo-sim.py has loaded you should be presented with a screen "TDL Compile-time options". 
You can expand or collapse any of the subsets of hierarchical options by clicking the "+" or "-" signs. 
As you can see there are a lot to choose from, and for this simulation we'll ignore most of them.

<br/> 

<figure>
  <center> <img src="images/fulls/TDL_Compile_OptionsInitial.png" width="60%">
   <figcaption> Figure 2. Simulation: Loaded the turbo-sim.py script.  </figcaption> </center>
</figure>

First, lets simulate visibilities without noise or any instrumental corruption. Here we want
to see what the instrument would observe if we had a perfect instrument, noise-free and the medium in 
which the signal is propagating is free of disturbances.
<p>
Make sure that the MS loaded is correct. If is not, click right side of MS: option and load it. 
Another important switch is the "Simulation mode: sim only" option. This just means
the visibilities generated by this simulation will overwrite whatever is in the MS.
You can also add and subtract to existing visibilities which is useful but we won't cover this. 
We're using all interferometers (synonymous with baselines) and all correlations (polarization products). 
	<br/>
	Lets familiarise ourselves with some of the options:
						</p>

						<h3> Inserting the Sky Model </h3>

As you might have noticed I expanded (using "+") the "Sky model" option and selected TiggerSkyModel. 
If your "Tigger LSM file" is "none" then click on none to select the sky model. Below this, you have the 
option to choose to use only a subset of sources in the sky model but for our case we will be using
all the sources, so you should set "Source subset" to "all". 

<blockquote type="width:150px;float:right;" background-color=#383838>
      <font color="blue">Using only a subset of the sky model: </font>            
      In case at some point you would want to use a single source from your sky model 
to make simulations, the first thing to do is to make note of the name of the source.
One way to obtain the name is to load the sky model into Tigger and quote 
(or memorise if your memory still works) the name and insert on "Source subset". 
</blockquote>
For now we are not adding any corruption so you can ignore the rest of the options. 
Once this is all set up click "Compile" and MeqTrees will build a simulation tree. 
			<br/>
			<br />			
						<h3>Bookmarking </h3>
We will add a bookmark before starting 
At this point you can add a bookmark by selecting "Bookmarks" menu.
This will allow you to visualise the values of arbitrary nodes in the tree. 
Some pre-defined ones are provided by turbo-sim.py. The bookmarks will help you observe the output visibilities. 
		Select "Output visibilities: inspector plot" (see Fig 3).

<figure>
  <center><img src="images/fulls/griddedviewTDL1.png" width="70%">
  <figcaption> Figure 3. Gridded Viewer showing bookmarked output visibilities </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
						<br />
						<h3> Running Simulation </h3>
<p>
Before running simulation, make you sure that you choose the appropriate column to simulate
the data in. Thus, in the "TDL Jobs and Run-time" 
set <font color="red"> "Output MS column" to "DATA" </font> . This is where the visibility measurements are written 
	for real observations. </p>

The "Tile size (timeslots)" option determines the size of the data chunks that are processed. Generally, 
the higher this is the less time it will take to process your simulation, and how high you can set it generally 
depends on how expensive your computer was.  It won't make much difference here though as this is such a small simulation. 
Set this to <font color="red"> Tile size(timeslots) = 8 </font>. I prefer choosing a smaller number 
(but you wouldn't want to do this for big data) so that I can see the data processing. 
<br />
Ignore "Imaging options" for now, we'll get on to this after running the simulation. <font color="red"> Click on 
"Run Simulation" </font>. At this point you should be able to see plots appearing on the Gridded viewer. 
See the green (relative amplitudes per baseline, XX) and red (phases, XX) plots below. <br />

On the Gridded viewer menu, zoom into one of the baselines by left clicking and dragging the cursor around 
the area of interest. You will see that the visibilities are smooth across the time. 
<br />

						</figure>
	<h3> Imaging </h3>

You have noticed that after running the simulations the "TDL Jobs &amp; Run Options" disappear. 
To open this again you don't need to open TDL again but you can click on <font color="red"> TDL Exec </font>. 
<br/>
On the "TDL Jobs &amp; Runtime Options" expand imaging options, see Fig 7. 
You have two types of images you can make; (1) the dirty image and (2) the clean image 
(expand <font color="red">make clean image </font>). The dirty image is the sky image convolved by the dirty 
beam or Point spread function (PSF, fourier transform of the uv-coverage). The dirty image has 
sidelobes which are due to spaces in the uv-coverage. To remove these sidelobes we use deconvolution
(or <font face="MathJax_SansSerif" > CLEAN </font>) algorithms such as
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif" > clark </font>, <font face="MathJax_SansSerif" > csclean </font>, 
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> WsClean</font> and <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> hogbom </font>.
<br/>

<figure>
  <center><img src="images/fulls/TDLimaging01.png" width="60%">
   <figcaption> Figure 7. Imaging Options </figcaption> </center>
</figure> 						
<ul>
<li>"Name of the FITS file": if you set this to default it will name based on the MS, the data column and number of channel. To avoid replacing the important images later, set this to <font color="red">Simulation_noise_free_dirty.fits </font>.
<li> Imaging weights: leave it to natural. See imaging lectures to learn about these weightings.
<li> <font color="red"> image size, in pixels: 1024 </font>
<li> <font color="red"> image size, in arcmin: 180 </font> (this is the cell size) using you want it less or equal to the resolution element.
<li> <font color="red"> Autostart image viewer: tigger </font>. Other option is  <font face="MathJax_SansSerif" size="2em"> kvis </font> or you can choose to enter any which is supported. 
<li> <font color="red"> Click on make dirty image </font>
						</ul>
<p>
You should find an image that looks like Fig 8. Also, you can play around with DR by changing the numbers at the bottom
or click the last button with red, yellow, green bars and adjust the limits of the plot by right clicking at each point 
	on the plot (I used [-0.05018, 0.1051]). You can close the image when you're satisfied. </p>
					
<figure>
  <center><img src="images/fulls/dirty01.png" width="60%">
  <figcaption> Figure 8. Dirty Image: Noise and Corruption Free </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
<p>
Lets make a clean image so that we can see the difference. To open the "TDL Jobs &amp; Runtime Options again" 
click on <font color="red"> "TDL Exec" </font>. Then, go to imaging options and don't change any of the above settings, 
expand the "make clean image" as in Fig 7, and leave the default settings i.e  <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> clark </font>,
etc. <font color="red">Click on make clean image </font>. 
						</p>
<blockquote>
At times an empty image pops out and that will be unfortunate if that happens in this practical :). 
	The problem with this
	is that normally we don't create a clean image using the  
 DATA column -- you don't want to clean corrupted data (although, you can get away with this for simulations just like I did).
	Thus, you will need to resimulate the data into CORRECTED_DATA
	and then make the clean image. Your output should look like Fig 9.

						<h2> Noise-Simulation: Lets Add the Noise </h2>

Lets load the "TDL" again and now we don't need to load "turbo-sim.py" because we have one. Select Reload the
Existing TDL script. The "TDL Compile-time Options" should appear. 

To add the noise expand "Add noise". You can choose to add noise directly "Add noise, Jy per visibility" or use 
the second option where you can enter the SEFD, bandwidth and integration time -- expand "Compute from SEFD" option.

<ol>
<li>For the first option, you will normally use radiometer equation to compute the noise. But I prefer if 
	<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees </font> computes this for me. Usually, 
you can use this option to put any random noise value there
, e.g 50 Jy per visibility. You are allowed to experiement.

<li> The second option, the SEFD for KAT7 is ~1290 (assuming system temperature of 35K, but 30K is usually 
the average one. Perhaps you might want to compute SEFD using 30K). Recall that integration time was 60 second and 
bandwidth 16MHz.  
						</ol>
Note that the noise specified here is noise per visibility measurement
and not the desired noise for your image. When using the second option we should see the noise 
~0.02944Jy per visibility measurement which is too small, thus in your 
sparetime you might want to experiement by setting the noise higher, say 20Jy per visibility and deselecting
"Compute from SEFD". You should be able to see very noisy-like visibilities. 
<br/>
For now we should leave it to ~0.02944Jy per visibility. Again <font color="red">click Compile, open bookmarks, 
and click run simulation</font>. On the bookmark or gridded screen you will see the output visibilities and 
try to see if you can spot any difference. First, you will need to zoom in unless your eyes have high resolution.
To zoom in, left click and drag the cursor to select the area of interest. You will see that the visibilities are 
not as smooth anymore but noise-like. 
<br/>

			<h2>Corruption Simulation: UV Plane Components </h2>

It is time to add something interesting. For this practicals we will only concern ourselves with the effects 
that occur within the antennas referred to as uv-plane components. 
We have to types of antenna-based (direction-independent) errors available to add; (1) feed angle error and (2)
receiver complex gains. The former occurs when the feeds are misaligned and are not in focus. We will not consider this.
To add receiver gains and phase errors, activate the 'Use G-Jones (gains/phases)' option in the uv-plane components section.
There are a few toy error models that you can play around with here. You are encouraged to experiment, as always!
For this simulation use the following options

<br /> 
<figure>
  <center> <img src="images/fulls/gainerrors001.png" width="60%">
   <figcaption> Figure 11. Adding Receiver complex gains. </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
<p>
The example above applies a periodically varying error to the gain and phase components. This applies a sinusoidal
wobble comple receiver gains to the visibilities. With the period randomized between the 
specified min and max values, resulting in different drift rates for each element in the array. 
</p>
			<p>
When you are done, <font color="red"> click compile </font>. First things first, open the Bookmarks. 
Now you should see an extra option <font color="red">"G-Jones: Inspector plot"</font>. This is the most
important plot at this stage but I encourage that both tabs are open. At the top of your Grided Viewer you should have
"Output Visbilities: Inspect plot" also open but if not, go to bookmark and open the option. 
			</p>
Check if the output column is set correctly to <font color="red">"DATA" </font>. Click  
	<font color="red">"Run Simulation"</font>. The G-Jones and Output visibilities must now be plotted and click 
on their open tabs to view them. If you click on the G-Jones: Inspector plot you should see Figure 12. 
This plot shows the real part of the gain corruptions for each of the seven antennas in the array for the
XX polarization. You can flip between the complex products and the polarization products in the 
viewer using the buttons in the lower right.

   <figcaption> Figure 12. G-Jones Inspector plot: Real of the XX polarisation. </figcaption> </center>
</figure>

<br/>
Lets make the dirty image. You normally don't want to create clean image of the corrupted visibilities. Open the 
	imaging options and carry on as we did previously, but now change the <font color="red"> output Fits file to
Simulated_Gcorrupted_dirty.fits </font>.  Figure 13 shows the dirty image of the corrupted visibilities;

				<h1> Calibration Time </h1>

Similar to Siamese, <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees </font> consist of a calibration framework 
contain in a file called "Calico". Go to <font color="red"> TDL </font>, naviate to <font color="red"> Cattery </font>
then <font color="red"> Calico </font> and choose <font color="red"> calico-stefcal.py </font>.
<p>
As with the SIMULATION, calibration also takes the MS and the sky model. Calibration constructs the RIME by corrupting
the sky model visibilities with various image plane (DD) and uv-plane (DI) effcts. And instead of simply predicting data
and writing it to the MS, it predicts data and compares this to the existing data the that MS contains. 
It compares these using a numerical solver that minimises the difference between the observed and the predicted 
visibilities.
</p>
					<p>
Check if the MS is correct and Load the Sky model as before. The RIME offers ridiculous amounts of flexibility,
as partially evidenced by the daunting amount of compile time options in that popped up when the script is loaded, 
but all we'll be solving for here are the G-Jones terms, i.e. a single solvable complex gain term for each element of
the array. Most of the options will be ignored for now. 
					</p>
<figure>
  <center><img src="images/fulls/2GCcalib.png" width="60%">
  <figcaption> Figure 13. Calibration Options: calico-stefcal.py . </figcaption> </center>
</figure>

<p>

<font color="red"> Output visibilities: </font> Here you are selecting the visibilities  you want to output.
This can be the corrected visibilities, residual visibilities and so on. We leave the rest as defaults. The type of 
Jones matrices we using is the diagonal gain "GianDiag". This just sets up a 2x2 Jones matrix for each
	antenna with solvable terms on the diagonal (XX/YY). </p>

Click compile. 

<p> There are a few more options in the run time menu than we are used to with the simulation script.
	Expand <font color="red"> Data selection and flagging  </font> menu and 
ensure that <font color="red">'Input MS column' = DATA </font> and 
<font color="red">'Output MS column' = CORRECTED_DATA </font>. This just means you are calibrating the visibilities
stored in the column DATA and that you writing and storing the calibrated visibilities in the CORRECTED_DATA column.
</p>

<p>'Read flags from MS' option: you set this option if you have flagged data column in your MS and you don't want to 
be solving for data that you've flagged as RFI for example.
Select Remove all the exisiting gain solutions, unless you want to add into the existing.</p>

<p>
Select <font color="red"> Click on Run StefCal</font> </p>

  <center><img src="images/fulls/calico-tdljobs.png" width="60%">
   <figcaption> Figure 14. Calibration: TDL Jobs and Runtime Options. </figcaption> </center>
</figure>
<p>
Finally, we can image our corrected data. Expand the Make an image from this MS option on the TDL Jobs and Runtime Options.
If it was closed, go to TDL Exece to open it.  
From there you can change the Name of the Output FITS file  to <font color="red"> Calibrated_GJones_dirty.fits 
</font> and for making a clean image use <font color="red"> Calibrated_GJones_clean.fits </font>. Change image size 
and pixel size to be the same as those we used above. And leave the rest like we did earlier. Make both the images and
they should look something like this DR= [ -0.1082, 0.2245]:
