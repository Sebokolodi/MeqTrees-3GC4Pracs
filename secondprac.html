							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header> 
						
The main purpose of this practical is to give us a basic intro to
direction dependent (DD) calibration as implemented in <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font>. If you recall
from previous lectures and <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> practical, that 2GC methods assume that all propagation
effects are direction independent (DI) and any present DD effect is the same across all
the receivers (trivial DDEs). This approximation is valid for narrower field of views but has 
already started showing its limitations even for smaller arrays such as the KAT7. 
The DD calibration technique implemented on <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> is called
the differential gains (DGs). 
This approach solves for G-Jones (DI) and DD effects simultaneously.
It does this by estimating and correcting for receiver gain drifts (i.e GJones) on short
time/frequency scales and the DGs on longer time/frequency scales. So the G solutions subsume all the DDEs towards
the dominant source in the field and the DGs solves for these DDEs in the direction
of these sources. 
						<p>
In this practical, we are going to use real observation data whereas in the previous MeqTrees 2GC practical we
had to generate our own visibilities (through simulations) to calibrate. We going to calibrate the KAT7 data.

							<h2>Check List</h2>
						</header> 
	First, before we get ahead of ourselves, let us check it we have all the necessary files to perform calibration.
	 Log in to elwood. On your home directory you will find folder named "MeqTrees3GC" and in this folder you should
		find the following
	<ul>
		<li> The sky model : <font color="blue"> dee4.lsm.html </font>

		<li> The Measurement Set: <font color="blue"> deep4-10s-10ch.ms </font>
		</ul>

							<h2> Imaging the Field</h2>
						</header> 
					
Let us start by imaging the visibilities so that we can have some idea of what we are in for. 
<font color ="blue"> Open meqbroswer, press start, go to TDL then Load TDL Script and navigate to Cattery then
calico and load calico-stefcal.py. On the open "TDL Compile-time Options" Load the MS file and 
click Compile </font>. A "TDL Jobs &amp; Runtime Option" window should appear and expand the "Imaging Options" and set the following;
<ul>
<li> Image type or column: <font color="blue"> DATA </font>
<li> Name of output FITS file: name this <font color="blue"> Original_field_clean.fits</font>
 <li> Image size, in pixels: <font color="blue"> 1024 </font>
<li> Image size, in arcmin: <font color="blue"> 180 </font>	 
	<li> Expand the <font color="blue"> Make a clean Image </font>
<li> Clean Algorithm: <font color="blue" face="MathJax_Serif"> clark </font>. Fortunately, this clean algorithm can make a 
	clean image from the DATA column.
<li> Number of iterations: <font color="blue"> 3000 </font>
<li> Leave the rest as defaults
	<li> Click on <font color="blue"> Make a clean image </font>
					</ul>		
You should see the image below:

							<h2> G Only Calibration: 2GC</h2>
						</header> 
Reload the TDL by <font color="blue"> clicking on reload </font> option next to the TDL Exec. 
The "TDL Compile-time Options" window should reappear. 
Now we going to correct for receiver complex gains (G-Jones) i.e. 2GC. 
Figure 2 shows the settings used for this prac. First, <font color="blue"> ensure that the MS files is correct </font>.
<font color="blue"> Expand the “Sky model” option and select “TiggerSkyModel” and load the sky model “deep4.lsm.html”</font>.
We want to output the <font color="blue"> corrected data </font>.
<font color="blue"> Expand and select the " Use G-Jones direction-independent gain" </font> . 
Set the <font color="blue"> solution interval, time axis to 5 and frequency axis to 10 </font>.
The Jones Matrix type should be set to<font color="blue"> GainDiag </font>, select <font color="blue"> enable visualization </font>. 
Leave the number of <font colot="blue"> major loops to 2 </font> and the rest of the options as defaults.

<font color="blue"> Click Compile </font>. The "TDL Jobs &amp; Runtime Options" window will appear. 
<font color="blue"> Expand the DATA selection &amp; flag handling </font>. <font color="red"> Input MS column: DATA </font>, 
<font color="blue"> Output MS column: CORRECTED_DATA </font>. Set <font color="blue"> tile size (time slots) to 3000 </font>. 
<font color="red"> Expand and Select Read flags from MS </font>– this is to ensure that the flagged RFI data, 
iif any, are taken care off. On the main Menu go to <font colot="blue"> Bookmarks and select 
output visibilities inspect plot and G-Jones inspector plot </font>. 
After this, you can click <font color="blue"> Run StefCal </font>.
