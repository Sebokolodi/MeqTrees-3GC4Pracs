In this practical, we are now going to use <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to corrupt the incoming signal
with direction dependent effects (DDEs) unlike in the previous practical, 
<a href="https://sebokolodi.github.io/MeqTrees-3GC4Pracs/index.html"> MeqTrees2GC </a>,
where we only dealt with direction-idependent effects (DIEs, in particular, the receiver gains or G-Jones). 
If you recall, 2GC methods
assume that all the DDEs are the same across all antennas, thus,
can be approximated as being DI. This approximation is valid for narrower field of views and small interferometers
						but has shown to be insufficient to deal with the data from the newly built
large interferometers.  The latter see through different atmospheres and consist of 
complicated and imperfect beams (mispointings, parallatic rotation).  
<p>						
So essentially, what we are going to do in this practical is to corrupt the signal
	with DDEs and then see what we get after applying only the G-Jones correction. 
Later, I will introduce you to a technique that is currently available on
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to correct for DDEs. 
This technique is known as the differential gains (DGs) -- this term must be familiar to you by now 
	(that is if you were not taking a quick nap which probably highly recommended during workshops). </p>
