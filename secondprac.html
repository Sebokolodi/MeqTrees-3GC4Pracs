							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header> 
						
The main purpose of this practical is to give us a basic intro to
direction dependent (DD) calibration as implemented in <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font>. If you recall
from previous lectures and <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> practical, that 2GC methods assume that all propagation
effects are direction independent (DI) and any present DD effect is the same across all
the receivers (trivial DDEs). This approximation is valid for narrower field of views but has 
already started showing its limitations even for smaller arrays such as the KAT7. 
The DD calibration technique implemented on <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> is called
the differential gains (DGs). 
This approach solves for G-Jones (DI) and DD effects simultaneously.
It does this by estimating and correcting for receiver gain drifts (i.e GJones) on short
time/frequency scales and the DGs on longer time/frequency scales. So the G solutions subsume all the DDEs towards
the dominant source in the field and the DGs solves for these DDEs in the direction
of these sources. 
						<p>
In this practical, we are going to use real observation data whereas in the previous MeqTrees 2GC practical we
had to generate our own visibilities (through simulations) to calibrate. We going to calibrate the KAT7 data.

							<h2>Check List</h2>
						</header> 
	First, before we get ahead of ourselves, let us check it we have all the necessary files to perform calibration.
	 Log in to elwood. On your home directory you will find folder named "MeqTrees3GC" and in this folder you should
		find the following
	<ul>
		<li> The sky model : <font color="blue"> dee4.lsm.html </font>

		<li> The Measurement Set: <font color="blue"> deep4-10s-10ch.ms </font>
		</ul>

							<h2> Imaging the Field</h2>
						</header> 
					
Let us start by imaging the visibilities so that we can have some idea of what we are in for. 
<font color ="blue"> Open meqbroswer, press start, go to TDL then Load TDL Script and navigate to Cattery then
calico and load calico-stefcal.py. On the open "TDL Compile-time Options" Load the MS file and 
click Compile </font>. A "TDL Jobs &amp; Runtime Option" window should appear and expand the "Imaging Options" and set the following;
<ul>
<li> Image type or column: <font color="blue"> DATA </font>
<li> Name of output FITS file: name this <font color="blue"> Original_field_clean.fits</font>
 <li> Image size, in pixels: <font color="blue"> 1024 </font>
<li> Image size, in arcmin: <font color="blue"> 180 </font>	 
	<li> Expand the <font color="blue"> Make a clean Image </font>
<li> Clean Algorithm: <font color="blue" face="MathJax_Serif"> clark </font>. Fortunately, this clean algorithm can make a 
	clean image from the DATA column.
<li> Number of iterations: <font color="blue"> 3000 </font>
<li> Leave the rest as defaults
	<li> Click on <font color="blue"> Make a clean image </font>
					</ul>		
You should see the image below. I have used <font face="MathJax_Serif">Tigger </font> to change the dynamic
	range of the image. You can also changing this by click on the red, yellow, green
bars at the bottom write of the open tigger image and cliping the noise distribution plot that appears or by simply editing
					the numbers at the bottom. I used [-0.001958, 0.006591].
