In this practical, we are now going to use <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to corrupt the
visibilities with direction dependent effects (DDEs) unlike in the previous practical, 
<a href="https://sebokolodi.github.io/MeqTrees-3GC4Pracs/index.html"> MeqTrees2GC </a>,
where we only dealt with direction-idependent effects (DIEs, in particular, the receiver gains or G-Jones). 
If you recall, 2GC methods
assumed that all the DDEs behave are the same across all antennas, thus,
can be approximated as being DI. But this is not true especially for the recently built
large interferometers which see through different atmospheres and consist of 
complicated and imperfect beams that mispoints and/or rotates over the course of the observation. Perhaps the latter
is not such new information since even single telescopes have 
pointing errors, etc but the sensitivities of these instrument makes these effects significant. 
<p>						
So essentially, what we going to do is corrupt the signal with DDEs and then see what happens when we calibrate 
the visibiliites using only the G-Jones. And later, I will
introduce you to technique that is currently available on
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to correct for DDEs. 
This technique is called the differential gains (DGs) -- this term must be familiar from the previous lectures
	(that is if you were not taking a quick nap which probably allowed during workshops). </p>
