							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header> 
In this practical, we are now going to use <font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to corrupt the incoming signal
with direction dependent effects (DDEs) unlike in the previous practical, 
<a href="https://sebokolodi.github.io/MeqTrees-3GC4Pracs/index.html"> MeqTrees2GC </a>,
where we only dealt with direction-idependent effects (DIEs, in particular, the receiver gains or G-Jones). 
If you recall, 2GC methods
assume that all the DDEs are the same across all antennas, thus,
can be approximated as being DI. This approximation is valid for narrower field of views and small interferometers
						but has shown to be insufficient to deal with the data from the newly built
large interferometers.  The latter see through different atmospheres and consist of 
complicated and imperfect beams (mispointings, parallatic rotation).  
<p>						
So essentially, what we are going to do in this practical is to corrupt the signal
	with DDEs and then see what we get after applying only the G-Jones correction. 
Later, I will introduce you to a technique that is currently available on
<font face="MathJax_SansSerif"> MeqTrees</font> to correct for DDEs. 
This technique is known as the differential gains (DGs) -- this term must be familiar to you by now 
	(that is if you were not taking a quick nap which probably highly recommended during workshops). </p>
						
Note that I will include all the relevant steps to carry out this
practical but I won't provide explainations to most of the things and you may need to
refer to <a href="https://sebokolodi.github.io/MeqTrees-3GC4Pracs/index.html"> MeqTrees2GC </a>
 or ask me and/or preferably my supervisors :).

							<h2>Simulation: DIE + DDE</h2>
						</header> 
	First, before we get ahead of ourselves, let us check it we have all the necessary files to perform simulations
		and
		calibrations. Log in to elwood and on your home make a new directort and give it a reason name e.g
		MeqTrees3GC, and then copy the files below from ... into this new directory. 
	<ul>
		<li> The sky model (<font color="blue"> summs_field.lsm.html </font>)
		<li> The <font face="MathJax_Serif" > simms </font> configuration <font color="blue"> config.json </font>
		<li> The antenna configuration table, <font color="blue"> KAT7_ANTENNAS </font>
		</ul>
		<p>
 When you are done copying, generate a new empty MS file: simms -jc config.json 
		</p>
	<p>
		Now open <font face="MathJax_Serif"> MeqTrees </font>: meqbrowser
		</p>
		Press <font color="red"> start </font> and a "TDL Options &amp;" window should open. Go to "TDL Options"
		and "Load TDL script" and naviate to Catter folder -- Siamese -- then load the 
		<font color="red"> turbo_sim.py </font>.
